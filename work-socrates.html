					Green Room seeks to provide the Socrates Sculpture Park and surrounding Community a celebratory and better functioning flexible system of spaces for workshops, fellows, visitors, and all events which might use the education workspace. Green Roomâ€™s design conflates its Park surroundings into a blended manmade / natural environment that is essentially a room without a ceiling and without walls, with a ceiling you can see through, and with walls you can see through which can enclose a room or rooms or can be retracted, both of which can act as incubators for new plants for the Park. What is performed and made in the Green Room is of and central to the Park. Green Room appears to be a folly by its apparent lack of the presumptive architecture of ceiling, walls, and program. But it functions as flexible and theatrical infrastructure based on the requirements of a number and variety of persons perceptions from within, able to work with some focus and primacy while not losing sight of their surroundings.
