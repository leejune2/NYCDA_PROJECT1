				This project introduces the site in the conceptualization of architecture. It involves the design of the space between buildings and the effects of their relationship on the urban fabric and the architectural object.
				</p>
				<p>
				Borrowing from Rem Koolhaas and Pier Vittorio Aureli, Suburbanurbanurban re-conceptualizes their discussion of the city block as an island which asserts its own autonomy within the urban fabric. What will happen if the regularities of the typical suburban block are displaced by difference? What will happen to the Somerville city block when it is packed with the density of Kowloon, or Manhattan? What will happen to suburbia when atypical conditions flood its grid? 
				</p>
				<p>
				Ultimately, Suburbanurbanurban is an attempt to reveal what would happen when the ubiquity of something as typical as a New England suburban home begins to propagate difference. It unifies extreme conditions of the urban and suburban to create a kind of organized chaos which is neither distinctly urban nor suburban. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Through difference, these two very typical houses and their arrangement would completely reposition the sense of calm typified in the domesticity of suburbia.
